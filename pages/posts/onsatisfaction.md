# On Satisfaction 

A core tenet of my beliefs on how to tackle life are about stoicism. Accepting the world as it is and relinquishing control over what can be and be doubling down on my reactions to the world. We can't control that much anyways.

Recently came across this piece by Anne Helen Peterson that I've been struggling to make peace with in this world of marketing and advertising that functions on creating a feeling of desire.

>Instead of looking around my living space with gratitude for the soft comfort I've built for myself, inflected with my  peculiar tastes and preferences, I see lack. And that dissatisfaction becomes a sort of lingering fog, dampening my experience of the world.

Something I lean on a lot is gratitude. Being excited and feeling blessed to have the things that I have. A roof over my head, clothes on my back and a great community that I invest in regularly. The flipside to this is desire. Desire is the hole in the bucket of gratefulness.

>...but then you look up and realize you're not just trying to make a few things better, or easier or more straightforward - you're dissatisfied with your whole damn life, and have been for some time.

The question of where to draw that line is something I'm still nailing down, but I know there's a difference between being grateful for the crumbs that you can get out of life and taking action to create the life you want for yourself.
