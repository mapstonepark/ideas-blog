From Netflix tv show **The Recruit** Season One Episode 2 39m50s in

New agent is having trouble finding out information about a former asset and goes to a new mentor like individual on how he can proceed when official documentation isn't giving him any useful information.

>You need her hall file. RUMINT. Rumors intelligence. A hall fall isn't a physical file. Its gossip. Things that were said in the halls of whatever station she was handled out of. Target a case officer who might be willing to talk to you about her.


Hate to say that one should rely on rumors, but sometimes if you want the truth about a situation, you need to keep an ear to the ground about what people are saying.
